<h3>About this page and what I've learnt so far</h3>
<h4>Where is the data coming from?</h4>
<p>Currently, I have a very simple js function working.  I have stored the information about our trip in an array with objects in that array detailing each leg of the journey.  I have then used that array, to display information (in a very unbeautiful format - on the page ).  Ultimately, I would like the data to come from our trips collections in the mongoDB</p>
<h4>How am I accessing it</h4>
<p>So far, I am working with the data about each journey from one place to another.  I have found this very challenging! With the initial functions which I wrote to retrieve the individual journeys, I used the ECMA6 forEach loops.  This worked well for that particular use case.   </p>
<p>The calculating the cost function, I found challenging.  I finally solved this by using the following</p>
<ul>
 <ol>a filter function, to select only those things with costs in them</ol>
 <ol>a map function - to enable me to more readily access the values in the object nested in the array</ol>; and
 <ol>then the reduce method</ol>
</ul>
<h4>How are you getting things on the page?</h4>
<p>Currently, I am working with the DOM only to get things on the page. </p>
<h4>What is helping you</h4>
<p>See chapter 4-6 of Eloquent Javascript</p>
