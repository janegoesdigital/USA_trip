# What is this?
This set of code is a work in progress.  I am using it to do both:
- try things; and
- create a record of my key learnings for later reference.

# Current structure
The current structure now has 4 main parts to it:

1. The draft sites I have.  There are now 4 sites within this section:
  * Itinerary_simple.  Initially, I used only very basic html, css, js and direct DOM manipulation methods.  I have now added materialize.css styling and jQuery functions.  I will be adding to this as I go;
  * Mongoose_simple - I'm working through connecting to a Mongodb using mongoose.  Also using express and handlebars;
  * Express_simple - although this is not working;
  * Itinerary_express - where I am going to rebuild my itinerary using mongo, mongoose, express and handlebars. 

2. A section called My_notes.  In it, I have consolidated the notes I am taking as I'm learning, and exercises etc that I am doing based on books I am reading.  It is my own personal reference material.

3. A WIP section, for code that I am working on.

4. An navigation bar around the site.  Currently, this is sitting in reflections.html, and does not appear on the other html pages that I am using.  I will put it on each relevant page, when I get Express and templates etc up and running in this site.  For my purposes, I know my way around and don't need it for navigation purposes, although it is a good overview for me on what I've learned so far.


#Current focus
Currently, I am focusing on having a deep understanding of html, css javascript, and the associated MEAN stack.  I
am sort of working my way conceptually through these things like a bridge with a focus on:
- the front end - how do I get stuff on the page.  I have had a particular focus on forms - one side of the bridge; and
- the back-end - the other side of the bridge.  I currently have mongodb running locally, and am working out how to connect it to the front-end with mongoose and express.
At some point, the front-end and back-end will meet to make a whole website - just like a bridge see!

#Scenario
I am using a scenario of using a website to plan and then go on a trip to the USA.  (I am from Australia).  It's a pretty good scenario,  because I am in fact planning a trip to the USA, and will be going on one shortly! For two months!  Lucky me!  Typically, I do all the planning in excel.  I'm just now seeing what I can come up with if I do it via a website.
