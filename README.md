# What is this?
This set of code is a work in progress.  I am using it to do both:
-try things; and
-create a record of my key learnings for later reference.

# Current structure
It's current structure is a bit of mess because it's evolving as both a concept and a practice, as I try different things.


#Current focus
Currently, I am focusing on having a deep understanding of htmls, css javascript, and the associated MEAN stack.  I
sort of working my way like a bridge with a focus on:
- the front end - how do I get stuff on the page.  I have had a particular focus on forms; and
- the back-end.  I currently have mongodb running locally, and am working out how to connect it to the front-end wit mongoose and express.
At some point, the front-end and back-end will meet to make a whole website - just like a website see!

#Scenario
I am using a scenario of planning and going on a trip to the USA.  (I am from Australia).  It's a pretty good scenario,  because I am in fact planning a trip to the USA, and will be going on one shortly.  Typically, I do all the planning in excel.  I'm just now seeing what I can come up with if I do it via a website.
