            <h1>About this page and what I've learnt so far</h1>
            <h2>Where is the data coming from?</h2>
            <p>Currently, I have a very simple js function working. I have stored the information about our trip in an array with objects in that array detailing each leg of the journey. I have then used that array, to display information (in a very unbeautiful
                format - on the page ). Ultimately, I would like the data to come from our trips collections in the mongoDB</p>
            <h2>How am I accessing it</h2>
            <p>So far, I am working with the data about each journey from one place to another. I have found this very challenging! With the initial functions which I wrote to retrieve the individual journeys, I used the ECMA6 forEach loops. This worked
                well for that particular use case. </p>
            <p>The calculating the cost function, I found challenging. I initially solved this by using the following</p>
            <ol>
                <li>a filter function, to select only those things with costs in them</li>
                <li>a map function - to enable me to more readily access the values in the object nested in the array</li>; and
                <li>then the reduce method</li>
             <p>This was far too complicted than it needed to be.  I have now simplified that function in trips.js file and pushed the costs into an array and used the reduce function for it.</p>
            </ol>
            <h4>How are you getting things on the page?</h4>
            <p>Currently, I am working with the DOM only to get things on the page. </p>
            <h4>What is helping you</h4>
