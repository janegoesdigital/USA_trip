<h1>How do I use data collected from a form?</h1>
<nav>

<div>
  <h2>Receiving the data from the forms and using it in javascript
  is working out what's been selected</h2>

  <p>So, I need to know what has been selected. It will be selected on click</p>
  <p>There are two actions here when using a radio button, There is a click in the radio button, followed by a click on the button to submit the form. </p>

  <h3>Selecting radio buttons</h3>
  <p>This will select all the radio buttons with the name=eventType </p>
  <p class="snippet">$( "input[name=eventType]:radio" )</p>

  <p>This will get the element</p>

  <p class="snippet">$("input[name=chooseEvent]")</p>

  <p>This will get the value selected </p>
  <p class="snippet">$( "input[name=eventType]:checked").val();</p>

  <p>In the js, define the returned value as a variable, and then use it in the JS </p>



  <p>see <a href="https://api.jquery.com/radio-selector/">jQuery</a></p>

  <p>when the choose event button is clicked, create a variable with the value equal to the radio button with a name of eventType and return the value </p>
  <p>Once I know what has been selected, I have different workflows depending on what's been selected</p>
  <p>If an eventType with a value of stay has been submitted, I'll show the date picker etc </p>
